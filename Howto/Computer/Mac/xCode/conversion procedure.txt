@section 	Procedure start the Migrator

	If you’ve already updated to Swift 2.3 you will need to go to Edit > Convert >
	To Current Swift Syntax

		Establish project-level .git if not present
		Open in xCode 8.3.3 (tgt: iPhone 7+ Sim)
		Allow Keychain Access (all)
		A->'Convert'->'Next'->'Save'
		B->Double-Click->'Perform Changes'
		Product->Clean
		Product->Build
		Explicit Errors -> '!'
		Run (Sim)
		Close
		Zip & replace!
	
	
	From there select Convert to Swift 3, select your schemes, and complete the
	steps in the assistant migrator..


@section 	Notes 

	It’s preferable to be restrictive where applicable when using
	these methods, if your class conforms to public and doesn’t need to be
	subclassed or overridden outside of the module then I would stick to public,
	otherwise use open where necessary
